Talon draft is an overlay which can be used to dictate and alter text before sending it to an application.
It holds some features like easily moving the text cursor over to specific parts of a sentence, as well as replacement and a whole lot more.

<*Displaying the draft window/>

<*draft show/> shows the draft window.
<*draft hide/> hides the draft window.
<*draft show large/> shows a slightly larger draft window.
<*draft show small/> shows the regular sized window.
<*draft show <window position>/> shows the draft window at the given position. For example, <*draft show top/> shows it at the top.
Possible options are top, bottom, left, right and middle.

<*draft edit/> opens the draft window with the selected text.
<*draft edit all/> selects all the text in the current text area before opening up the draft window with it.
<*draft empty/> clears the draft window.
<*draft submit/> sends the contents of the draft window to the next application.

<*Text editing/>

Most of the regular edit options are available in the draft window, like <*go word left/> and so on, but there are draft window specific edit commands that come in handy.
In the draft window you see words with red letters underneath them. These letters are called anchors, and can be accessed with the Talon alphabet to be used in these commands.

<*cursor <letter>/> will place the cursor in front of that word. For example, <*cursor air/> will place the text cursor in front of the first word.
<*cursor after <letter>/> will place the cursor at the back of the anchored word.
<*replace <letter> with <word>/> will replace the word at the cursor with the given <word>. <*replace air with ground/> will replace the first word with the word ground.
<*select <letter>/> will select the anchored word.
<*clear <letter>/> will clear the anchored word.
<*<formatters> word <letter>/> will replace the word with the formatted word. So <*allcaps word air/> will replace the first word with a version which only uses capitalized letters.

There are also commands that allow you to manipulate multiple words at the same time.

<*select <letter> through <letter2>/> will select all the words from the first letter to the last. So <*select air through cap/> will select the first three words.
<*clear <letter> through <letter2>/> will remove all the words from the first letter to the last.
<*<formatters> <letter> through <letter2>/> will replace all the words from the first letter to the last with the given formatting.
