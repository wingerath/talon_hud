<*Animations/>
If you prefer having a more basic animation free set up, or want to switch back to an animated display, you can use the following commands  
<*head up basic <widget name>/> disables animations on the chosen widget.  
<*head up fancy <widget name>/> enables animations on the chosen widget.

<*Text / font size and alignment/>
Every widget that displays text can have the size changed.
<*head up text scale <widget name>/> starts resizing the text in the widget. Move the mouse around until you have a comfortable size.
Then say <*head up confirm/> to select the font size.

Some widgets like the event log also allow you to change the text direction and alignment.
<*head up align <widget name> left/> aligns the text and the widget to the left side of its bounds.  
<*head up align <widget name> right/> aligns the text and the widget to the right side of its bounds.
<*head up align <widget name> top/> changes the direction in which content is placed upwards.  
<*head up align <widget name> bottom/> changes the direction in which content is placed downwards.

<*Position and size/>
You can change the position of one or more widgets by dragging them around with the mouse, or by saying <*head up drag <widget names>/>.
<*head up drop/> confirms and saves the changes of your changed widget.

You can also resize the widgets to your liking.

<*head up resize <widget name>/> starts resizing the widgets width and height.  
<*head up expand <widget name>/> changes the maximum size of the widget in case the content does not fit the regular width and height.  

For both of these, <*head up drop/> or <*head up confirm/> will save the changes. If something went wrong, hiding the widget or saying <*head up cancel/> should bring everything back to what it was before.

<*Keeping widgets around during sleep/>
By default, most of the widgets except for the status bar will hide themselves when Talon goes in sleep mode to reduce screen clutter, but you can keep them around, or hide them, with the following commands.  

<*head up show <widget name> on sleep/> keeps the chosen widget enabled during sleep mode.  
<*head up hide <widget name> on sleep/> hides the chosen widget when sleep mode is turned on.
